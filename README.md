# Basic Chronometer

This is a simple chronometer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created to practice and improve my skills in front-end web development, especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Start/Stop functionality**: Allows the user to start and stop the chronometer.
- **Reset functionality**: Resets the chronometer back to 0.
- **CSS Animations**: Buttons have simple animations for a smoother user experience.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to start using the chronometer.

## I'm Learning JavaScript!

Since I'm just starting with JavaScript, I would love to receive project ideas or challenges to help me improve my skills. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request with your ideas!

Your feedback and ideas will be greatly appreciated as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.
